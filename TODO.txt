Extractor now fully extracts type info and constructs method calls.
However, somet types require explicit casting, such as arrays of objects and etc. They need to wrap all objects in the array and then return.

Enums, Static Methods, Properties and SIGNAL/SLOT via PHP Functions are still needed.


* Abstract classes should not have a constructor (new)
* Multiple Inheritance methods!! (e.g. QWidget)
